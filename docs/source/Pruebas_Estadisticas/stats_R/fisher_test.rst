fisher.test {stats}
===================

Realiza la prueba exacta de Fisher para probar la hipótesis nula de independencia de filas y columnas en una tabla de contingencia con marginales 
fijos.

.. code:: R

   fisher.test(x, y = NULL, workspace = 200000, hybrid = FALSE,
            hybridPars = c(expect = 5, percent = 80, Emin = 1),
            control = list(), or = 1, alternative = "two.sided",
            conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95,
            simulate.p.value = FALSE, B = 2000)

Ejemplos:

.. code:: R

   ## Agresti (1990, p. 61f; 2002, p. 91) Fisher's Tea Drinker
   ## A British woman claimed to be able to distinguish whether milk or
   ##  tea was added to the cup first.  To test, she was given 8 cups of
   ##  tea, in four of which milk was added first.  The null hypothesis
   ##  is that there is no association between the true order of pouring
   ##  and the woman's guess, the alternative that there is a positive
   ##  association (that the odds ratio is greater than 1).
   TeaTasting <-
     matrix(c(3, 1, 1, 3),
       nrow = 2,
       dimnames = list(Guess = c("Milk", "Tea"),
                       Truth = c("Milk", "Tea")))
   fisher.test(TeaTasting, alternative = "greater")
   ## => p = 0.2429, association could not be established

   ## Fisher (1962, 1970), Criminal convictions of like-sex twins
   Convictions <- matrix(c(2, 10, 15, 3), nrow = 2,
	              dimnames =
	       list(c("Dizygotic", "Monozygotic"),
		    c("Convicted", "Not convicted")))
   Convictions
   fisher.test(Convictions, alternative = "less")
   fisher.test(Convictions, conf.int = FALSE)
   fisher.test(Convictions, conf.level = 0.95)$conf.int
   fisher.test(Convictions, conf.level = 0.99)$conf.int

   ## A r x c table  Agresti (2002, p. 57) Job Satisfaction
   Job <- matrix(c(1,2,1,0, 3,3,6,1, 10,10,14,9, 6,7,12,11), 4, 4,
           dimnames = list(income = c("< 15k", "15-25k", "25-40k", "> 40k"),
                     satisfaction = c("VeryD", "LittleD", "ModerateS", "VeryS")))
   fisher.test(Job) # 0.7827
   fisher.test(Job, simulate.p.value = TRUE, B = 1e5) # also close to 0.78

   ## 6th example in Mehta & Patel's JASA paper
   MP6 <- rbind(
        c(1,2,2,1,1,0,1),
        c(2,0,0,2,3,0,0),
        c(0,1,1,1,2,7,3),
        c(1,1,2,0,0,0,1),
        c(0,1,1,1,1,0,0))
   fisher.test(MP6)
   # Exactly the same p-value, as Cochran's conditions are never met:
   fisher.test(MP6, hybrid=TRUE)
