The simplest example of a DDE is given by

.. math::

   x'(t) = −x(t − τ \text{ ) f }or t ≥ 0,

where τ > 0 is called the delay. Suppose the initial condition for (2.1) is given
by

.. math::

   x(t) = 1 for t ∈ [−τ, 0]. (2.2)

Following the procedure called the method of steps described in [5, p.13-14], the
solution x(t) for t ∈ [(n−1)τ, nτ ], n ∈ N, can be determined in the following way.
