EXAMPLE 9.3.1
Després et al. (A-1) point out that the topography of adipose tissue (AT) is associated
with metabolic complications considered as risk factors for cardiovascular disease. It
is important, they state, to measure the amount of intraabdominal AT as part of the
evaluation of the cardiovascular-disease risk of an individual. Computed tomography
(CT), the only available technique that precisely and reliably measures the amount of
deep abdominal AT, however, is costly and requires irradiation of the subject. In addition,
the technique is not available to many physicians. Després and his colleagues conducted
a study to develop equations to predict the amount of deep abdominal AT from
simple anthropometric measurements. Their subjects were men between the ages of 18
and 42 years who were free from metabolic disease that would require treatment.

Among the measurements taken on each subject were deep abdominal AT obtained by
CT and waist circumference as shown in Table 9.3.1. A question of interest is how
well one can predict and estimate deep abdominal AT from knowledge of the waist
circumference. This question is typical of those that can be answered by means of
regression analysis. Since deep abdominal AT is the variable about which we wish to
make predictions and estimations, it is the dependent variable. The variable waist measurement,
knowledge of which will be used to make the predictions and estimations, is
the independent variable.

**EVALUATING THE REGRESSION EQUATION**

**EXAMPLE 9.4.1**

Refer to Example 9.3.1. We wish to know if we can conclude that, in the population
from which our sample was drawn, X and Y are linearly related.

**Estimating the Population Coefficient of Determination**

**EXAMPLE 9.4.2**

Refer to Example 9.3.1. We wish to know if we can conclude that the slope of the
population regression line describing the relationship between X and Y is zero.

**EXAMPLE 9.4.3**

Refer to Example 9.3.1. We wish to use residual plots to test the assumptions of linearity
and equal variances in the data.
