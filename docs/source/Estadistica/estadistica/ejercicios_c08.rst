**EXAMPLE 8.2.1**

Game meats, including those from white-tailed deer and eastern gray squirrels, are
used as food by families, hunters, and other individuals for health, cultural, or personal
reasons. A study by David Holben (A-1) assessed the selenium content of meat
from free-roaming white-tailed deer (venison) and gray squirrel (squirrel) obtained
from a low selenium region of the United States. These selenium content values were
also compared to those of beef produced within and outside the same region. We want
to know if the selenium levels are different in the four meat groups.

**EXAMPLE 8.2.2**

Let us illustrate the use of the HSD test with the data from Example 8.2.1.

8.3 THE RANDOMIZED COMPLETE BLOCK DESIGN

EXAMPLE 8.3.1
A physical therapist wished to compare three methods for teaching patients to use a certain
prosthetic device. He felt that the rate of learning would be different for patients of
different ages and wished to design an experiment in which the influence of age could
be taken into account.

**8.4 THE REPEATED MEASURES DESIGN**

EXAMPLE 8.4.1
Licciardone et al. (A-15) examined subjects with chronic, nonspecific low back pain.
In this study, 18 of the subjects completed a survey questionnaire assessing physical
functioning at baseline, and after 1, 3, and 6 months. Table 8.4.1 shows the data
for these subjects who received a sham treatment that appeared to be genuine osteopathic
manipulation. Higher values indicate better physical functioning. The goal of
the experiment was to determine if subjects would report improvement over time
even though the treatment they received would provide minimal improvement. We
wish to know if there is a difference in the mean survey values among the four points
in time.

**8.5 THE FACTORIAL EXPERIMENT**

**EXAMPLE 8.5.1**

Suppose, in terms of effect on reaction time, that the true relationship between three dosage
levels of some drug and the age of human subjects taking the drug is known. Suppose further
that age occurs at two levels—“young” (under 65) and “old” (65 and older). If the
true relationship between the two factors is known, we will know, for the three dosage levels,
the mean effect on reaction time of subjects in the two age groups. Let us assume that
effect is measured in terms of reduction in reaction time to some stimulus. Suppose these
means are as shown in Table 8.5.1.
The following important features of the data in Table 8.5.1 should be noted.
1. For both levels of factor A the difference between the means for any two levels of
factor B is the same. That is, for both levels of factor A, the difference between means
for levels 1 and 2 is 5, for levels 2 and 3 the difference is 10, and for levels 1 and 3
the difference is 15.
2. For all levels of factor B the difference between means for the two levels of factor A
is the same. In the present case the difference is 5 at all three levels of factor B.
3. A third characteristic is revealed when the data are plotted as in Figure 8.5.1. We note
that the curves corresponding to the different levels of a factor are all parallel.

**EXAMPLE 8.5.2**

In a study of length of time spent on individual home visits by public health nurses,
data were reported on length of home visit, in minutes, by a sample of 80 nurses. A
record was made also of each nurse’s age and the type of illness of each patient visited.
The researchers wished to obtain from their investigation answers to the following
questions:

1. Does the mean length of home visit differ among different age groups of nurses?

2. Does the type of patient affect the mean length of home visit?

3. Is there interaction between nurse’s age and type of patient?
