Numeric vectors

In this chapter, we discuss the uttermost common operations on numeric vectors. They are so fundamental that we will also find them 
in other scientific computing environments, including Python with numpy or tensorflow, Julia, MATLAB, GNU Octave, or Scilab.

At first blush, the number of functions we are going to explore may seem quite large. Still, the reader is kindly asked to place some 
trust (a rare thing these days) in yours truly. It is because our selection is comprised only of the most representative and 
educational amongst the plethora of possible choices. More complex building blocks can often be reduced to a creative combination of 
the former or be easily found in a number of additional packages or libraries (e.g., GNU GSL [28]).

A solid understanding of base R programming is crucial fordealing with popular packages (such as data.table, dplyr, or caret). Most 
importantly, base R‚Äôs API is stable. Hence, the code we compose today will most likely work the same way in ten years. It is often 
not the case when we rely on external add-ons.

Inthesequel,wewillbeadvocatingaminimalist,keep-it-simpleapproachtotheartof programming data processing pipelines, one that is a 
healthy balance between ‚Äúdoing itallbyourselves‚Äù,‚Äúminimisingtheinformationoverload‚Äù,‚Äúbeinglazy‚Äù,and‚Äústanding on the shoulders of 
giants‚Äù.

Note The exercises that we suggest in the sequel are all self-contained, unless explicitly stated otherwise. The use of language 
constructs that are yet to be formally introduced (in particular, if, for, and while explained in Chapter 8) is not just unnecessary: 
it is discouraged. Moreover, we recommend against taking shortcuts by looking up partial solutions on the internet. Rather, to get 
the most out of this course, we should be seeking relevant information within the current and preceding chapters as well as the R 
help system.

2.1 Creating numeric vectors

2.1.1 Numeric constants

The simplest numeric vectors are those of length one:

-3.14 ## [1] -3.14 1.23e-4 ## [1] 0.000123

The latter is in what we call scientific notation, which is a convenient means of entering numbers of very large or small orders of 
magnitude. Here, ‚Äúe‚Äù stands for ‚Äú‚Ä¶ times 10 to thepowerof‚Ä¶‚Äù.Therefore, 1.23e-4 isequalto1.23√ó10 ‚àí4 = 0.000123.Inotherwords, given 
1.23, we move the decimal separator by four digits towards the left, adding zeroes if necessary.

In real life, some information items may be inherently or temporarily missing, unknown, or Not Available. As R is orientated towards 
data processing, it was equipped with a special indicator:

NA_real_ ## [1] NA

# numeric NA (missing value)

It is similar to the Null marker in database query languages such as SQL. Note that NA_real_ is displayed simply as ‚ÄúNA‚Äù, chiefly for 
readability.

Moreover, Inf denotes infinity, ‚àû, i.e., an element that is larger than the largest representable double-precision (64 bit) floating 
point value. Also, NaN stands for not-anumber, which is returned as the result of some illegal operations, e.g., 0/0 or ‚àû ‚àí ‚àû.

Let‚Äôs provide a few ways to create numeric vectors with possibly more than one element.

2.1.2 Concatenating vectors with c

First, the c function can be used to combine (concatenate) many numeric vectors, each of any length. It results in a single object:

c(1, 2, 3) # three vectors of length one ‚Äì> one vector of length three ## [1] 1 2 3 c(1, c(2, NA_real_, 4), 5, c(6, c(7, Inf))) ## 
[1] 1 2 NA 4 5 6 7 Inf

Note Running help("c"), we will see that its usage is like c(...). In the current context, this means that the c function takes an 
arbitrary number of arguments. In Section 9.4.6, we will study the dot-dot-dot (ellipsis) parameter in more detail.

2.1.3 Repeating entries with rep

Second, rep replicates the elements in a vector a given number of times.

rep(1, 5) ## [1] 1 1 1 1 1 rep(c(1, 2, 3), 4) ## [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3

In the second case, the whole vector (1, 2, 3) has been recycled (tiled) four times. Interestingly, if the second argument is a 
vector of the same length as the first one, the behaviour will be different:

rep(c(1, 2, 3), c(2, 1, 4)) ## [1] 1 1 2 3 3 3 3 rep(c(1, 2, 3), c(4, 4, 4)) ## [1] 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3

Here, each element is repeated the corresponding number of times.

Calling help("rep"), we find that the function‚Äôs usage is like rep(x, ...). It is rather peculiar. However, reading further, we 
discover that the ellipsis (dot-dot-dot) may be fed with one of the following parameters:

‚Ä¢ times,

‚Ä¢ length.out 1 ,

‚Ä¢ each.

So far, we have been playing with times, which is listed second in the parameter list (after x, the vector whose elements are to be 
repeated).

Important The undermentioned function calls are all equivalent:

rep(c(1, 2, 3), 4) # positional matching of arguments: `x`, then `times` # `times` is the second argument rep(x=c(1, 2, 3), times=4) 
# keyword arguments of the form name=value rep(times=4, x=c(1, 2, 3)) # keyword arguments can be given in any order # mixed 
positional and keyword arguments

rep(c(1, 2, 3), times=4)

rep(times=4, c(1, 2, 3))

We can also pass each or length.out, but their names must be mentioned explicitly:

rep(c(1, 2, 3), length.out=7)

## [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 ## [1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 ## [1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3

rep(c(1, 2, 3), each=3)

rep(c(1, 2, 3), length.out=7, each=3)

Note Whether we consider a good programming practice the implementation of a

range of varied behaviours inside a single function is a question of taste. On the one hand, in all of the preceding examples, we do 
repeat the input elements somehow, so remembering just one function name is really convenient. Nevertheless, a drastic change in the 
repetition pattern depending, e.g., on the length of the times argument can be bug-prone. Anyway, we have been warned 2 .

Zero-length vectors are possible too:

rep(c(1, 2, 3), 0) ## numeric(0)

Even though their handling might be a little tricky, we will later see that they are indispensable in contexts like ‚Äúcreate an empty 
data frame with a specific column structure‚Äù.

Also, note that R often allows for partial matching of named arguments, but its use is a bad programming practice; see Section 15.4.4 
for more details.

rep(c(1, 2, 3), len=7) # not recommended (see later) ## Warning in rep(c(1, 2, 3), len = 7): partial argument match of 'len' to ## 
'length.out' ## [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1

We see the warning only because we have set options(warnPartialMatchArgs=TRUE) in our environment. It is not used by default.

2.1.4 Generating arithmetic progressions with seq and `:`

Third, we can call the seq function to create a sequence of equally-spaced numbers on a linear scale, i.e., an arithmetic 
progression.

seq(1, 15, 2) ## [1] 1 3

5

7

9 11 13 15

From the function‚Äôs help page, we discover that seq accepts the from, to, by, and length.out arguments, amongst others. Thus, the 
preceding call is equivalent to:

seq(from=1, to=15, by=2)

## [1]

1

3

5

7

9 11 13 15

Note that to actually means ‚Äúup to‚Äù:

seq(from=1, to=16, by=2)

## [1]

1

3

5

7

9 11 13 15

We can also pass length.out instead of by. In such a case, the increments or decrements will be computed via the formula ((to - 
from)/(length.out - 1)). This default value is reported in the Usage section of help("seq").

seq(1, 0, length.out=5)

## [1] 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.00 seq(length.out=5) # default `from` is 1 ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5

Arithmetic progressions with steps equal to 1 or -1 can also be generated via the `:` operator.

1:10 # seq(1, 10) or seq(1, 10, 1) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

-1:10 # seq(-1, 10) or seq(-1, 10, 1) ## [1] -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

-1:-10 # seq(-1, -10) or seq(-1, -10, -1)

## [1] -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 -10

Let‚Äôs highlight the order of precedence of this operator: -1:10 means (-1):10, and not -(1:10); compare Section 2.4.3.

Exercise 2.1 Take a look at the manual page of seq_along and seq_len and determine whether we can do without them, having seq 3 at 
hand.

2.1.5 Generating pseudorandom numbers

We can also generate sequences drawn independently from a range of univariate probability distributions.

runif(7) # uniform U(0, 1) ## [1] 0.287578 0.788305 0.408977 0.883017 0.940467 0.045556 0.528105 rnorm(7) # normal N(0, 1) ## [1] 
1.23950 -0.10897 -0.11724 0.18308 1.28055 -1.72727 1.69018

These correspond to seven pseudorandom deviates from the uniform distribution on the unit interval (i.e., (0, 1)) and the standard 
normal distribution (i.e., with expectation 0 and standard deviation 1), respectively; compare Figure 2.3.

For more named distribution classes frequently occur in various real-world statistical modelling exercises, see Section 2.3.4.

Another worthwhile function picks items from a given vector, either with or without replacement:

sample(1:10, 20, replace=TRUE) ## [1] 3 3 10 2 6 5 4 sample(1:10, 5, replace=FALSE) ## [1] 9 3 4 6 1

6

# 20 with replacement (allow repetitions) 9 10 5 3 9 9 9 3 8 10 7 10 # 5 without replacement (do not repeat)

Thedistributionofthesampledvaluesdoesnotneedtobeuniform;the prob argument may be fed with a vector of the corresponding 
probabilities. For example, here are 20 independent realisations of the random variable ùëã such that Pr(ùëã = 0) = 0.9 (the 
probability that we obtain 0 is equal to 90%) and Pr(ùëã = 1) = 0.1:

sample(0:1, 20, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.9, 0.1)) ## [1] 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1

Note If n is a single number (a numeric vector of length 1), then sample(n, ...) is equivalent to sample(1:n, ...). Similarly, seq(n) 
is a synonym for seq(1, n) or seq(1, length(n)), depending on the length of n. This is a dangerous behaviour that can occasionally 
backfire and lead to bugs (check what happens when n is, e.g., 0). Nonetheless, we have been warned. From now on, we are going to be 
extra careful (but are we really?). Read more at help("sample") and help("seq").

Let‚Äôsstressthatthenumbersweobtainaremerelypseudorandombecausetheyaregenerated algorithmically. R uses the Mersenne-Twister MT19937 
method [46] by default; see help("RNG") and [21, 29, 42]. By setting the seed of the random number generator, i.e., resetting its 
state to a given one, we can obtain results that are reproducible.

set.seed(12345) # seeds are specified with integers sample(1:10, 5, replace=TRUE) # a,b,c,d,e ## [1] 3 10 8 10 8 sample(1:10, 5, 
replace=TRUE) # f,g,h,i,j ## [1] 2 6 6 7 10

Setting the seed to the one used previously gives:

set.seed(12345) sample(1:10, 5, replace=TRUE) ## [1] 3 10 8 10 8

# a,b,c,d,e

We did not(?) expect that! And now for something completely different:

set.seed(12345) sample(1:10, 10, replace=TRUE) ## [1] 3 10 8 10 8 2 6

6

# a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j 7 10

Reproducibilityisacrucialfeatureofeachtruly scientificexperiment.Thesame initial condition (here: the same seed) leads to exactly the 
same outcomes.

Note Some claim that the only unsuspicious seed is 42 but in matters of taste, there

canbenodisputes.Everyonecanusetheirfavouritepicks:yourstrulysavours123,1234, and 12345 as well.

When performing many runs of Monte Carlo experiments, it may also be a clever idea to call set.seed(i) in the ùëñ-th iteration of a 
simulation we are trying to program.

We should ensure that our seed settings are applied consistently across all our scripts. Otherwise, we might be accused of tampering 
with evidence. For instance, here is the ultimate proof that we are very lucky today:

set.seed(1679619) # totally unsuspicious, right? sample(0:1, 20, replace=TRUE) # so random ## [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
1 1

This is exactly why reproducible scripts and auxiliary data should be published alongside all research reports or papers. Only open, 
transparent science can be fully trustworthy.

If set.seed is not called explicitly, and the random state is not restored from the 
previouslysavedRsession(seeChapter16),thentherandomgeneratorisinitialisedbased on the current wall time and the identifier of the 
running R instance (PID). This may justify the impression that the numbers we generate appear surprising.

To understand the ‚Äúpseudo‚Äù part of the said randomness better, in Section 8.3, we will build a very simple random generator 
ourselves.

2.1.6 Reading data with scan

An example text file named euraud-20200101-20200630.csv 4 gives the EUR to AUD exchange rates (how many Australian Dollars can we buy 
for 1 Euro) from 1 January to 30 June 2020 (remember COVID-19?). Let‚Äôs preview the first couple of lines:

# EUR/AUD Exchange Rates # Source: Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank System # 
https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/ # (provided free of charge) NA

1.6006

1.6031 NA

The four header lines that begin with ‚Äú#‚Äù merely serve as comments for us humans. They should be ignored by the interpreter. The 
first ‚Äúreal‚Äù value, NA, corresponds to 1 January (Wednesday, New Year‚Äôs Day; Forex markets were closed, hence a missing observation).

We can invoke the scan function to read all the inputs and convert them to a single numeric vector:

We used the paste0 function (Section 6.1.3) to concatenate two long strings (too long to fit a single line of code) and form a single 
URL.

We can also read the files located on our computer. For example:

scan("~/Projects/teaching-data/marek/euraud-20200101-20200630.csv",

comment.char="#")

It used an absolute file path that starts at the user‚Äôs home directory, denoted ‚Äú~‚Äù. Yours truly‚Äôs case is /home/gagolews.

Note

For portability reasons, we suggest slashes, ‚Äú/‚Äù, as path separators; see also help("file.path") and help(".Platform"). They are 
recognised by all UNIX-like boxes as well as by other popular operating systems, including Wi***ws. Note that URLs, such as 
https://deepr.gagolewski.com/, consist of slashes, too.

Paths can also be relative to the current working directory, denoted ‚Äú.‚Äù, which can be read via a call to getwd. Usually, it is the 
location wherefrom the R session has been started. For instance, if the working directory was /home/gagolews/ 
Projects/teaching-data/marek, we could write the file path equivalently as ./ euraud-20200101-20200630.csv or even 
euraud-20200101-20200630.csv.

On as side note, ‚Äú..‚Äù marks the parent directory of the current working directory. In the above example, ../r/iris.csv is equivalent 
to /home/gagolews/Projects/ teaching-data/r/iris.csv.

Exercise 2.2 Read the help page about scan. Take note of the following formal arguments and their meaning: dec, sep, what, 
comment.char, and na.strings.

Later we will discuss the read.table and read.csv functions. They are wrappers around scan that reads structured data. Also, write 
exports an atomic vector‚Äôs contents to a text file.

Example 2.3 Figure 2.1 shows the graph of the aforementioned exchange rates, which was generated by calling:

plot(scan(paste0("https://github.com/gagolews/teaching-data/raw/",

"master/marek/euraud-20200101-20200630.csv"), comment.char="#"),

xlab="Day", ylab="EUR/AUD")

Somewhat misleadingly (and for reasons that will become apparent later), the documentation of plot can be accessed by calling 
help("plot.default"). Read about, and experiment with, different values of the main, xlab, ylab, type, col, pch, cex, lty, and lwd 
arguments. More plotting routines will be discussed in Chapter 13.

2.2 Creating named objects

The objects we bring forth will often need to be memorised so that they can be referred to in further computations. The assignment 
operator, `<-`, can be used for this purpose:

x <- 1:3

# creates a numeric vector and binds the name `x` to it

The now-named object can be recalled 5 and dealt with as we please:

print(x) # or just `x` in the R console ## [1] 1 2 3

sum(x) ## [1] 6

# example operation: compute the sum of all elements in `x`

Important In R, all names are case-sensitive. Hence, x and X can coexist peacefully: when set, they refer to two different objects. 
If we tried calling Print(x), print(X), or PRINT(x), we would get an error.

Typically,wewillbeusingsyntacticnames.In help("make.names"),weread:Asyntactically valid name consists of letters, numbers and the dot 
or underline characters and starts with a letter or the dot not followed by a number. Names such as .2way are not valid, and neither 
are the reserved words such as if, for, function, next, and TRUE, but see Section 9.3.1 for an exception.

A fine name is self-explanatory and thus reader-friendly: patients, mean, and average_scores are way better (if they are what they 
claim they are) than xyz123, crap, or spam. Also, it might not be such a bad idea to get used to denoting:

‚Ä¢ vectors by x, y, z,

‚Ä¢ matrices (and matrix-like objects) by A, B, ‚Ä¶, X, Y, Z,

‚Ä¢ integer indexes by letters i, j, k, l,

‚Ä¢ object sizes by n, m, d, p or nx, ny, etc.,

especially when they are only of temporary nature (for storing auxiliary results, iterating over collections of objects, etc.).

There are numerous naming conventions that we can adopt, but most often they are a matter of taste; snake_case, lowerCamelCase, 
UpperCamelCase, flatcase, or dot. case are equally sound as long as they are used coherently (for instance, some use snake_case for 
vectors and UpperCamelCase for functions). Occasionally, we have little choice but to adhere to the naming conventions of the project 
we are about to contribute to.

Note Generally, a dot, ‚Äú.‚Äù, has no special meaning 6 ; na.omit is as appropriate a name as na_omit, naOmit, NAOMIT, naomit, and 
NaOmit. Readers who know other programming languages will need to habituate themselves to this convention.

R, as a dynamic language, allows for introducing new variables at any time. Moreover, existing names can be bound to new values. For 
instance:

(y <- "spam") ## [1] "spam"

# bracketed expression ‚Äì printing not suppressed

x <- y # overwrites the previous `x` print(x) ## [1] "spam"

Now x refers to a verbatim copy of y.

Note Objects are automatically destroyed when we cannot access them anymore. By now, the garbage collector is likely to have got rid 
of the foregoing 1:3 vector (to which the name x was bound previously).

2.3 Vectorised mathematical functions

Mathematically, we will be denoting a given vector ùíô of length ùëõ by (ùë• 1 , ùë• 2 , ‚Ä¶ , ùë• ùëõ ). In other words, ùë• ùëñ is its ùëñ-th 
element. Let‚Äôs review a few operations that are ubiquitous in numerical computing.

2.3.1 abs and sqrt

R implements vectorised versions of the most popular mathematical functions, e.g., abs (absolute value, |ùë•|) and sqrt (square root, 
‚àö ùë•).

abs(c(2, -1, 0, -3, NA_real_)) ## [1] 2 1 0 3 NA

Here, vectorised means that instead of being defined to act on a single numeric value, they are applied on each element in a vector. 
The ùëñ-th resulting item is a transformed version of the ùëñ-th input:

|ùíô| = (|ùë• 1 |, |ùë• 2 |, ‚Ä¶ , |ùë• ùëõ |).

Moreover, if an input is a missing value, the corresponding output will be marked as unknown as well.

Another example:

x <- c(4, 2, -1) (y <- sqrt(x)) ## Warning in sqrt(x): NaNs produced ## [1] 2.0000 1.4142 NaN

Toattractourattentiontothefactthatcomputingthesquarerootofanegativevalueis a reckless act, R generated an informative warning. 
However, a warning is not an error:

the result is being produced as usual. In this case, the ill value is marked as not-anumber.

Also, the fact that the irrational ‚àö 2 is displayed 7 as 1.4142 does not mean that it is such a crude approximation to 
1.414213562373095048801688724209698.... It was rounded when printing purely for aesthetic reasons. In fact, in Section 3.2.3, we will 
point out that the computer‚Äôs floating-point arithmetic has roughly 16 decimal digits precision (but we shall see that the devil is 
in the detail).

print(y, digits=16) # display more significant figures ## [1] 2.000000000000000 1.414213562373095

2.3.2 Rounding

NaN

The following functions drop all or portions of fractional parts of numbers:

‚Ä¢ floor(x) (rounds down to the nearest integer, denoted ‚åäùë•‚åã),

‚Ä¢ ceiling(x) (rounds up, denoted ‚åàùë•‚åâ = ‚àí‚åä‚àíùë•‚åã),

‚Ä¢ trunc(x) (rounds towards zero),

‚Ä¢ round(x, digits=0) (rounds to the nearest number with digits decimal digits).

For instance:

x <- c(7.0001, 6.9999, -4.3149, -5.19999, 123.4567, -765.4321, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5) floor(x) ## [1] 7 6 -5 -6 123 -766 0 1 2 ceiling(x) ## 
[1] 8 7 -4 -5 124 -765 1 2 3 trunc(x) ## [1] 7 6 -4 -5 123 -765 0 1 2

Note When we write that a function‚Äôs usage is like round(x, digits=0), compare help("round"), we mean that the digits parameter is 
equipped with the defaultvalue of 0. In other words, if rounding to 0 decimal digits is what we need, the second argument can be 
omitted.

round(x) # the same as round(x, 0); round half to even ## [1] 7 7 -4 -5 123 -765 0 2 2 round(x, 1) # round to tenths (nearest 0.1s) 
## [1] 7.0 7.0 -4.3 -5.2 123.5 -765.4 0.5 round(x, -2) # round to hundreds (nearest 100s) ## [1] 0 0 0 0 100 -800 0 0 0

2.3.3 Natural exponential function and logarithm

Moreover:

‚Ä¢ exp(x) outputs the natural exponential function, ùëí ùë• , where Euler‚Äôs number ùëí ‚âÉ

2.718,

‚Ä¢ log(x, base=exp(1)) computes, by default, the natural logarithm of ùë•, log ùëí ùë• (which is most often denoted simply by log ùë•).

Recall that if ùë• = ùëí ùë¶ , then log ùëí ùë• = ùë¶, i.e., one is the inverse of the other.

log(c(0, 1, 2.7183, 7.3891, 20.0855)) ## [1] -Inf 0 1 2 3 exp(c(0, 1, 2, 3)) ## [1] 1.0000 2.7183 7.3891 20.0855

# grows slowly

# grows fast

These functions enjoy a number of very valuable identities and inequalities. In particular, we should know from school that log(ùë• ‚ãÖ 
ùë¶) = log ùë• + log ùë¶, log(ùë• ùë¶ ) = ùë¶ log ùë•, and ùëí ùë•+ùë¶ = ùëí ùë• ‚ãÖ ùëí ùë¶ .

For the logarithm to a different base, say, log 10 ùë•, we can call:

log(c(0, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 1e10), 10) ## [1] -Inf 0 1 2 3 10

# or log(..., base=10)

Recall that if log ùëè ùë• = ùë¶, then ùë• = ùëè ùë¶ , for any 1 ‚â† ùëè > 0.

Example 2.4 Commonly, a logarithmic scale is used for variables that grow rapidly when expressed as functions of each other; see 
Figure 2.2.

x <- seq(0, 10, length.out=1001) par(mfrow=c(1, 2)) # two plots in one figure (one row, two columns) plot(x, exp(x), type="l") # left 
subplot plot(x, exp(x), type="l", log="y") # log-scale on the y-axis; right subplot

Let‚Äôs highlight that ùëí ùë• on the log-scale is nothing more than a straight line. Such a transformation of the axes can only be 
applied in the case of values strictly greater than 0.

2.3.4 Probability distributions (*)

‚Äì d (probability density function, PDF),

‚Äì p (cumulative distribution function, CDF; or survival function, SF),

‚Äì q (quantile function, being the inverse of the CDF),

‚Äì r (generation of random deviates; already mentioned above);

‚Ä¢ discrete distributions, i.e., those whose possible outcomes can easily be enumerated (e.g., some integers):

‚Äì *binom (binomial),

‚Äì *geom (geometric),

‚Äì *pois (Poisson),

‚Äì *hyper (hypergeometric),

‚Äì *nbinom (negative binomial);

prefixes ‚Äúp‚Äù and ‚Äúr‚Äù retain their meaning, however:

‚Äì d now gives the probability mass function (PMF),

‚Äì q brings about the quantile function, defined as a generalised inverse of the CDF.

Each distribution is characterised by a set of underlying parameters. For instance, a normal distribution N(ùúá, ùúé) can be pinpointed 
by setting its expected value ùúá ‚àà ‚Ñù and standard deviation ùúé > 0. In R, these two have been named mean and sd, respectively; see 
help("dnorm"). Therefore, e.g., dnorm(x, 1, 2) computes the PDF of N(1, 2) at x.

Note The parametrisations assumed in R can be subtly different from what we know from statistical textbooks or probability courses. 
For example, the normal distribution can be identified based on either standard deviation or variance, and the exponential 
distribution can be defined via expected value or its reciprocal. We thus advise the reader to study carefully the documentation of 
help("dnorm"), help("dunif"), help("dexp"), help("dbinom"), and the like.

It is also worth knowing the typical use cases of each of the distributions listed, e.g., a Poisson distribution can describe the 
probability of observing the number of independent events in a fixed time interval (e.g., the number of users downloading a copy of R 
from CRAN per hour), and an exponential distribution can model the time between such events; compare [23].

Exercise 2.5 A call to hist(x) draws a histogram, which can serve as an estimator of the underlying continuous probability density 
function of a given sample; see Figure 2.3 for an illustration.

par(mfrow=c(1, 2)) # two plots in one figure # left subplot: uniform U(0, 1)

hist(runif(10000, 0, 1), col="white", probability=TRUE, main="")

x <- seq(0, 1, length.out=101) lines(x, dunif(x, 0, 1), lwd=2) # right subplot: normal N(0, 1)

# draw the true density function (PDF)

hist(rnorm(10000, 0, 1), col="white", probability=TRUE, main="")

x <- seq(-4, 4, length.out=101) lines(x, dnorm(x, 0, 1), lwd=2)

# draw the PDF

Draw a histogram of some random samples of different sizes n from the following distributions:

‚Ä¢ rnorm(n, ¬µ, œÉ) ‚Äì normal N(ùúá, ùúé) with expected values ùúá ‚àà {‚àí1, 0, 5} (i.e., ùúá being equal to either ‚àí1, 0, or 5; read ‚Äú‚àà‚Äù as 
‚Äúbelongs to the given set‚Äù or ‚Äúin‚Äù) and standard deviations ùúé ‚àà {0.5, 1, 5};

‚Ä¢ runif(n, a, b) ‚Äì uniform U(ùëé, ùëè) on the interval (ùëé, ùëè) with ùëé = 0 and ùëè = 1 as well as ùëé = ‚àí1 and ùëè = 1;

‚Ä¢ rbeta(n, Œ±, Œ≤) ‚Äì beta B(ùõº, ùõΩ) with ùõº, ùõΩ ‚àà {0.5, 1, 2};

‚Ä¢ rexp(n, Œª) ‚Äì exponential E(ùúÜ) with rates ùúÜ ‚àà {0.5, 1, 10};

Moreover, read about and play with the breaks, main, xlab, ylab, xlim, ylim, and col parameters; see help("hist").

Example 2.6 We roll a six-sided dice twelve times. Let ùê∂ be a random variable describing the number of cases where the ‚Äú1‚Äù face is 
thrown. ùê∂ follows a binomial distribution Bin(ùëõ, ùëù) with parameters ùëõ = 12 (the number of Bernoulli trials) and ùëù = 1/6 (the 
probability of success in a single roll).

Theprobabilitymassfunction, dbinom,representstheprobabilitiesthatthenumberof‚Äú1‚Äùsrolled is equal to 0, 1, ‚Ä¶, or 12, i.e., ùëÉ(ùê∂ = 0), 
ùëÉ(ùê∂ = 1), ‚Ä¶, or ùëÉ(ùê∂ = 12), respectively:

round(dbinom(0:12, 12, 1/6), 2) # PMF at 13 different points ## [1] 0.11 0.27 0.30 0.20 0.09 0.03 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00

On the other hand, the probability that we throw no more than three ‚Äú1‚Äùs, ùëÉ(ùê∂ ‚â§ 3), can be determined by means of the cumulative 
distribution function, pbinom:

pbinom(3, 12, 1/6) ## [1] 0.87482

# pbinom(3, 12, 1/6, lower.tail=FALSE)

The smallest ùëê such that ùëÉ(ùê∂ ‚â§ ùëê) ‚â• 0.95 can be computed based on the quantile function:

qbinom(0.95, 12, 1/6) ## [1] 4 pbinom(3:4, 12, 1/6) ## [1] 0.87482 0.96365

# for comparison: 0.95 is in-between

In other words, at least 95% of the time, we will be observing no more than four successes. Also, here are 30 pseudorandom 
realisations (simulations) of the random variable ùê∂:

rbinom(30, 12, 1/6) # how many successes in 12 trials, repeated 30 times ## [1] 1 3 2 4 4 0 2 4 2 2 4 2 3 2 0 4 1 0 1 4 4 3 2 6 2 3 2 
2 1 1

2.3.5 Special functions (*)

Within mathematical formulae and across assorted application areas, certain functions appear more frequently than others. Hence, for 
the sake of notational brevity and computational precision, many of them have been assigned special names. For instance, the 
following functions are mentioned in the definitions related to a few probability distributions:

‚àû ‚Ä¢ gamma(x) for ùë• > 0 computes Œì(ùë•) = ‚à´ 0 ùë° ùë•‚àí1 ùëí ‚àíùë° ùëëùë°,

1 ‚Ä¢ beta(a, b) for ùëé, ùëè > 0 yields ùêµ(ùëé, ùëè) = Œì(ùëé)Œì(ùëè) Œì(ùëé+ùëè) = ‚à´ 0 ùë° ùëé‚àí1 (1 ‚àí ùë°) ùëè‚àí1 ùëëùë°.

Why do we have beta if it is merely a mix of gammas? A specific, tailored function is expected to be faster and more precise than its 
DIY version; its underlying implementation does not have to involve any calls to gamma.

beta(0.25, 250) # okay ## [1] 0.91213 gamma(0.25)*gamma(250)/gamma(250.25) ## [1] NaN

# not okay

The Œì function grows so rapidly that already gamma(172) gives rise to Inf. It is due to the fact that a computer‚Äôs arithmetic is not 
infinitely precise; compare Section 3.2.3.

Special functions are plentiful; see the open-access NISTDigitalLibraryofMathematical Functions [51] for one of the most definitive 
references (and also [2] for its predecessor). R package gsl [33] provides a vectorised interface to the GNU GSL [28] library, which 
implements many of such routines.

Exercise 2.7 The Pochhammer symbol, (ùëé) ùë• = Œì(ùëé + ùë•)/Œì(ùëé), can be computed via a call to gsl::poch(a, x), i.e., the poch 
function from the gsl package:

# call install.packages("gsl") first library("gsl") # load the package poch(10, 3:6) # calls gsl_sf_poch() from GNU GSL ## [1] 1320 
17160 240240 3603600

Readthedocumentationofthecorresponding gsl_sf_poch functionintheGNUGSLmanual 8 . And when you are there, do not hesitate to go 
through the list of all functions, including those related to statistics, permutations, combinations, and so forth.

Many functions also have their logarithm-of versions; see, e.g., lgamma and lbeta. Also, for instance, dnorm and dbeta have the log 
parameter. Their classical use case is the (numerical) maximum likelihood estimation, which involves the sums of the logarithms of 
densities.

2.4 Arithmetic operations

2.4.1 Vectorised arithmetic operators

R features the following binary arithmetic operators:

‚Ä¢ `+` (addition) and `-` (subtraction),

‚Ä¢ `*` (multiplication) and `/` (division),

‚Ä¢ `%/%` (integer division) and `%%` (modulo, division remainder),

‚Ä¢ `^` (exponentiation; synonym: `**`).

They are all vectorised: they take two vectors on input and produce another vector on output.

c(1, 2, 3) * c(10, 100, 1000) ## [1] 10 200 3000

Theoperationwasperformedinanelementwisefashiononthecorrespondingpairsofelements from both vectors. The first element in the left 
sequence was multiplied by the corresponding element in the right vector, and the result was stored in the first element of the 
output. Then, the second element in the left‚Ä¶ all right, we get it.

Other operators behave similarly:

0:10 + seq(0, 1, 0.1) ## [1] 0.0 1.1 2.2 3.3 4.4 5.5 6.6 7.7 8.8 9.9 11.0 0:7 / rep(3, length.out=8) # division by 3 ## [1] 0.00000 
0.33333 0.66667 1.00000 1.33333 1.66667 2.00000 2.33333 0:7 %/% rep(3, length.out=8) # integer division ## [1] 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 0:7 %% 
rep(3, length.out=8) # division remainder ## [1] 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1

Operations involving missing values also yield NAs:

c(1, NA_real_, 3, NA_real_) + c(NA_real_, 2, 3, NA_real_) ## [1] NA NA 6 NA

2.4.2 Recycling rule

Some of the preceding statements can be written more concisely. When the operands are of different lengths, the shorter one is 
recycled as many times as necessary, as in rep(y, length.out=length(x)). For example:

0:7 / 3 ## [1] 0.00000 0.33333 0.66667 1.00000 1.33333 1.66667 2.00000 2.33333 1:10 * c(-1, 1) ## [1] -1 2 -3 4 -5 6 -7 8 -9 10 2 ^ 
(0:10) ## [1] 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024

We call this the recycling rule.

Ifanoperandcannotberecycledinitsentirety,awarning 9 isgenerated,buttheoutput is still available.

c(1, 10, 100) * 1:8 ## Warning in c(1, 10, 100) * 1:8: longer object length is not a multiple of ## shorter object length ## [1] 1 20 
300 4 50 600 7 80

Vectorisation and the recycling rule are perhaps most fruitful when applying binary operators on sequences of identical lengths or 
when performing vector-scalar (i.e., a sequence vs a single value) operations. However, there is much more: schemes like ‚Äúevery ùëò-th 
element‚Äù appear in Taylor series expansions (multiply by c(-1, 1)), ùëò-fold cross-validation, etc.; see also Section 11.3.4 for use 
cases in matrix/tensor processing.

Also, pmin and pmax return the parallel minimum and maximum of the corresponding elements of the input vectors. Their behaviour is 
the same as the arithmetic operators, but we call them as ordinary functions:

pmin(c(1, 2, 3, 4), c(4, 2, 3, 1)) ## [1] 1 2 3 1 pmin(3, 1:5) ## [1] 1 2 3 3 3 pmax(0, pmin(1, c(0.25, -2, 5, -0.5, 0, 1.3, 0.99))) 
## [1] 0.25 0.00 1.00 0.00 0.00 1.00 0.99

# clipping to [0, 1]

Note Some functions can be very deeply vectorised, i.e., with respect to multiple arguments. For example:

runif(3, c(10, 20, 30), c(11, 22, 33)) ## [1] 10.288 21.577 31.227

generates three random numbers uniformly distributed over the intervals (10, 11), (20, 22), and (30, 33), respectively.

2.4.3 Operator precedence

Expressions involving multiple operators need a set of rules governing the order of computations (unless we enforce it using round 
brackets). We have said that

-1:10 means (-1):10 rather than -(1:10). But what about, say, 1+1+1+1+1*0 or 3*2^0:5+10?

Let‚Äôs list the operators mentioned so far in their order of precedence, from the least to the most binding (see also help("Syntax")):

1. `<-` (right to left),

2. `+` and `-` (binary),

3. `*` and `/`,

4. `%%` and `%/%`,

5. `:`,

6. `+` and `-` (unary),

7. `^` (right to left).

Hence, -2^2/3+3*4 means ((-(2^2))/3)+(3*4) and not, e.g., -((2^(2/(3+3)))*4). Notice that `+` and `-`, `*` and `/`, as well as `%%` 
and `%/%` have the same priority. Expressions involving a series of operations in the same group are evaluated left to right, with 
the exception of `^` and `<-`, which are performed the other way around. Therefore:

‚Ä¢ 2*3/4*5 is equivalent to ((2*3)/4)*5,

‚Ä¢ 2^3^4 is 2^(3^4) because, mathematically, we would write it as 2 3 4 = 2 81 ,

‚Ä¢ ‚Äúx <- y <- 4*3%%8/2‚Äù binds both y and x to 6, not x to the previous value of y and then y to 6.

When in doubt, we can always bracket a subexpression to ensure it is executed in the intended order. It can also increase the 
readability of our code.

2.4.4 Accumulating

The `+` and `*` operators, as well as the pmin and pmax functions, implement elementwise operations that are applied on the 
corresponding elements taken from two given

vectors. For instance:

ùë• 1 ùë¶ 1 ùë• 1 + ùë¶1  ‚éú ‚éõ ‚éü ‚éû ‚éú ‚éõ ‚éü ‚éû ‚éú ‚éõ ‚éü ‚éû ‚éú ‚éú ùë• 2 ‚éü ‚éü ‚éú ‚éú ùë¶ 2 ‚éü ‚éü ‚éú ‚éú ùë• 2 + ùë¶ 2 ‚éü ‚éü ‚éú ‚éú ùë• 3 ‚éü ‚éü 
+ ‚éú ‚éú ùë¶ 3 ‚éü ‚éü = ‚éú ‚éú ùë• 3 + ùë¶ 3 ‚éü ‚éü . ‚éú ‚éú ‚éü ‚éü ‚éú ‚éú ‚éü ‚éü ‚éú ‚éú ‚éü ‚éü ‚éú ‚éú ‚ãÆ ‚éü ‚éü ‚éú ‚éú ‚ãÆ ‚éü ‚éü ‚éú ‚éú ‚ãÆ ‚éü ‚éü

‚éù ùë• ùëõ ‚é† ‚éù ùë¶ ùëõ ‚é† ‚éù ùë• ùëõ + ùë¶ ùëõ ‚é†

However, we can also scan through all the values in a single vector and combine the successive elements that we inspect using the 
corresponding operation:

‚Ä¢ cumsum(x) gives the cumulative sum of the elements in a vector,

‚Ä¢ cumprod(x) computes the cumulative product,

‚Ä¢ cummin(x) yields the cumulative minimum,

‚Ä¢ cummax(x) breeds the cumulative maximum.

The ùëñ-th element in the output vector will consist of the sum/product/min/max of the first ùëñ inputs. For example:

ùë• 1 ùë•1  ‚éú ‚éõ ‚éü ‚éû ‚éú ‚éõ ‚éü ‚éû ‚éú ‚éú ùë• 2 ‚éü ‚éü ‚éú ‚éú ùë• 1 + ùë• 2 ‚éü ‚éü ‚éú ‚éú ùë• 3 ‚éü ‚éü = ‚éú ‚éú ùë• 1 + ùë• 2 + ùë• 3 ‚éü ‚éü . cumsum 
‚éú ‚éü ‚éú ‚éü ‚éú ‚éú ‚éü ‚éü ‚éú ‚éú ‚éü ‚éü ‚éú ‚ãÆ ‚éü ‚éú ‚ãÆ ‚ã± ‚éü

‚éù ùë• ùëõ ‚é† ‚éù ùë• 1 + ùë• 2 + ùë• 3 + ‚ãØ + ùë• ùëõ ‚é†

cumsum(1:8) ## [1] 1 3 6 10 15 21 28 36 cumprod(1:8) ## [1] 1 2 6 24 cummin(c(3, 2, 4, 5, 1, 6, 0)) ## [1] 3 2 2 2 1 1 0 cummax(c(3, 
2, 4, 5, 1, 6, 0)) ## [1] 3 3 4 5 5 6 6

120

720

5040 40320

Example 2.8 On a side note, diff can be considered an inverse to cumsum. It computes the iterated difference: subtracts the first two 
elements, then the second from the third one, the third from the fourth, and so on. In other words, diff(x) gives ùíö such that ùë¶ ùëñ 
= ùë• ùëñ+1 ‚àí ùë• ùëñ .

x <- c(-2, 3, 6, 2, 15) diff(x) ## [1] 5 3 -4 13 cumsum(diff(x)) ## [1] 5 8 4 17 cumsum(c(-2, diff(x))) ## [1] -2 3 6 2 15

# recreates x

Thanks to diff, we can compute the daily changes to the EUR/AUD forex rates studied earlier; see Figure 2.4.

aud <- scan(paste0("https://github.com/gagolews/teaching-data/raw/", aud_all <- na.omit(aud) # remove all missing values 
plot(diff(aud_all), type="s", ylab="Daily change [EUR/AUD]") # "steps"

"master/marek/euraud-20200101-20200630.csv"), comment.char="#")

abline(h=0, lty="dotted") # draw a horizontal line at y=0

2.4.5 Aggregating

If we are only concerned with the last cumulant, which summarises all the inputs, we have the following 10 functions at our disposal:

‚Ä¢ sum(x) computes the sum of elements in a vector, ‚àë ùëñ=1 ùëõ ùë• ùëñ = ùë• 1 + ùë• 2 + ‚ãØ + ùë• ùëõ ,

‚Ä¢ prod(x) outputs the product of all elements, ‚àè ùëñ=1 ùëõ ùë• ùëñ = ùë• 1 ùë• 2 ‚ãØ ùë• ùëõ ,

‚Ä¢ min(x) determines the minimum,

‚Ä¢ max(x) reckons the greatest value.

sum(1:8) ## [1] 36 prod(1:8) ## [1] 40320 min(c(3, 2, 4, 5, 1, 6, 0)) ## [1] 0

max(c(3, 2, 4, 5, 1, 6, 0)) ## [1] 6

The foregoing functions form the basis for the popular summary statistics 11 (sample aggregates) such as:

‚Ä¢ mean(x) gives the arithmetic mean, sum(x)/length(x),

‚Ä¢ var(x) yieldsthe(unbiased)samplevariance, sum((x-mean(x))^2)/(length(x)-1),

‚Ä¢ sd(x) is the standard deviation, sqrt(var(x)).

Furthermore, median(x) computes the sample median, i.e., the middle value in the sorted 12 version of x.

For instance:

x <- runif(1000) c(min(x), mean(x), median(x), max(x), sd(x)) ## [1] 0.00046535 0.49727780 0.48995025 0.99940453 0.28748391

Exercise 2.9 Let ùíô be any vector of length ùëõ with positive elements. Compute its geometric and harmonic mean, which are given by, 
respectively,

‚àö ùëõ 1 ‚àö ùëõ ùëõ ‚àö ‚àè ùë• ùëñ = ùëí ùëõ ‚àë ùëñ=1 ùëõ log ùë• ùëñ and . ‚é∑ ùëñ=1 ‚àë ùëñ=1 ùëõ ùë• ùëñ 1

Whensolvingexerciseslikethisone,itdoesnotreallymatterwhatdatayouapplythesefunctions

Allaggregationfunctions returna missingvalueifanyoftheinput elementsis unavailable. Luckily, they are equipped with the na.rm 
parameter, on behalf of which we can request the removal of NAs.

aud <- scan(paste0("https://github.com/gagolews/teaching-data/raw/", c(min(aud), mean(aud), max(aud)) ## [1] NA NA NA c(min(aud, 
na.rm=TRUE), mean(aud, na.rm=TRUE), max(aud, na.rm=TRUE)) ## [1] 1.6006 1.6775 1.8635

Otherwise, we could have called, e.g., mean(na.omit(x)).

Note In the documentation, we read that the usage of sum, prod, min, and max is like sum(..., na.rm=FALSE), etc. In this context, it 
means that they accept any number of input vectors, and each of them can be of arbitrary length. Therefore, min(1, 2, 3), min(c(1, 2, 
3)) as well as min(c(1, 2), 3) all return the same result.

However, we also read that we have mean(x, trim=0, na.rm=FALSE, ...). This time, 
onlyonevectorcanbeaggregated,andanyfurtherarguments(except trim and na.rm) are ignored.

Theextraflexibility(whichwedonothavetorelyon,ever)oftheformergroupisdueto their being associative operations.Wehave, e.g., (2+3)+4 = 
2+(3+4). Hence, these operations can be performed in any order, in any group. They are primitive operations: it is mean that is based 
on sum, not vice versa.

Exercise 2.11 Thanks to vectorisation, implementing an example graph of arcsine and arccosine is straightforward.

x <- seq(-1, 1, length.out=11) plot(x, asin(x),

# increase length.out for a smoother curve # asin() computed for 11 points # lines ylim=c(-pi/2, pi), # y axis limits like c(y_min, 
y_max) # y axis label lines(x, acos(x), col="red", lty="dashed") # adds to the current plot legend("topright", c("asin(x)", 
"acos(x)"),

type="l",

ylab="asin(x), acos(x)")

lty=c("solid", "dashed"), col=c("black", "red"), bg="white")

‚àë ùëñ=1 ùëõ (ùë• ùëñ ‚àí ùëõ 1 ‚àë ùëó=1 ùëõ ùë• ùëó ) (ùë¶ ùëñ ‚àí ùëõ 1 ‚àë ùëó=1 ùëõ ùë¶ ùëó ) ùëü = . ‚àö ‚àë ùëñ=1 ùëõ (ùë• ùëñ ‚àí 1 ‚àë ùëó=1 ùëõ ùë• ùëó ) 2 
‚àö ‚àë ùëñ=1 ùëõ (ùë¶ ùëñ ‚àí 1 ‚àë ùëó=1 ùëõ ùë¶ ùëó )2  ùëõ ùëõ

To make sure you have come up with a correct implementation, compare your result to a call to cor(x, y).
