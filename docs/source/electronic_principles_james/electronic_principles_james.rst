Electronic Principles - James
=============================

* conductor, semiconductor
* semiconductor doping
* p-n junctions
* diode biasing
* diode models
* static and dynamic resistance
* diode limitations

INT
---

* atomic makeup
* valence ring
* energy force
* current flow
* full outer valence ring
* silicon, germanium, contains four electrons in the valence ring

Making the P-N junction
-----------------------

* silicon is in dominant use

Intrinsic Crystals
------------------

* is to refine silicon into a pure crystaline form
