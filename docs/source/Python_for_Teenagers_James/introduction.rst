Introduction
============

Who This Book Is For
---------------------

This book is intended for teenagers looking to program in Python. While that technically
means anyone aged 13 through 18, the truth of the matter is, anyone of any age can (and
should, if I do say so myself!) pick up this book if they want to learn either (a) how to
program in Python, (b) how to program as a beginner, or (c) add Python to their current
skill set.

Above all, if you are holding this book in your hand, intrepid adventurer, then this
book is for you. The future is dependent on young heroes like yourself, eager to learn
the art of coding and go out into the world and safeguard it from nefarious hackers,
dubiously programmed applications, and the rise of artificially intelligent robots!

So whether you are in sixth grade or in college, this book will grant you with super
powers galore. Sure, you won’t be able to see through walls or lift cars over your head
once you finish this book. However, you will be able to speak the language of computers
and create some pretty cool programs.

And what could be better than that?

What You Will Learn in This Book
--------------------------------

Chapter 1 provides an overview of programming and Python and then shows you how
to install Python and a Python IDLE, which will allow you to create your own Python
programs and test your code.

In Chapter 2, we will discuss mathematical functions (things like division,
addition, and multiplication) and learn about the different data types used by Python.
We will also begin to build the foundation of a fun super hero generator app – “Super
Hero Generator 3000”!

Chapter 3 delves into how to work with text – also known as strings. We take a look
at the different types of storage Python offers as well. We wrap things up by looking at
common string functions and build another section of our Super Hero Generator 3000
application.

Sometimes a program will need to take a certain action depending upon feedback
from a user or from other influences. This is known as decision making and is the topic
of Chapter 4.

Programming logic and loops – known as iterations, where code can “loop” or repeat
itself based on certain conditions – are covered in Chapter 5.

Chapter 6 is a refresher course of what you have learned up until this point. We will
use all the knowledge we’ve acquired to finish building the first complete version of
Super Hero Generator 3000. By the end, you will be able to randomly create heroes with
unique super powers, names, and battle statistics!

In Chapter 7, we begin to learn more advanced techniques. To be a real coder, you
must learn efficiency and reduce mistakes in your code. That is where modules and
built-in functions come into play. Learn what they are and why they will make your life a
whole lot easier in this exciting chapter!

Chapter 8 looks at even more advanced topics: specifically, we will cover the basics
of object-oriented programming (OOP) and cover objects and classes and define a thing
called polymorphism.

To switch things up a little bit, Chapter 9 will look at some different types of data
structures, including tuples and dictionaries.

Chapter 10 brings us up to speed on how to create – and work with – files inside of
directories.

One of my personal favorite chapters is Chapter 11, which covers a topic that is
near and dear to my heart: Python for Gaming. We will stroll through the world of video
games and learn how to work with video game elements, including sound, animation,
and more!

Learning how to create games that interact with a users actions and making images
move within a game are truly what make games enjoyable. Chapter 12 continues the
topic of gaming and focuses specifically on game animation.

In Chapter 13 – don’t worry, in this case 13 is lucky, for you at least! – we move into
areas of Python we have not yet discussed that do not fit in their own chapter. This
includes how to debug – or find broken code. We also look at advanced modules and
other topics.

Finally, we sum everything up in Chapter 14 and cover a wide range of topics,
including how to find work as a Python programmer, common interview questions, the
future of Python, and career paths, and answer some of the frequently asked questions
(FAQs) about our favorite programming language.


So now that we know what we will learn, let’s put on our cape and super hero outfits
and get ready to leap tall buildings – of knowledge.

Why I Started Programming
-------------------------

I started programming a long, long time ago – back before the Internet or cell phones
existed and when wild dinosaurs roamed the earth. Back then, computers didn’t have
images on them like they do today. Everything was text-based – even most of our games –
the horror! While we did have some computer games with animation and graphics, they
were 8-bit and not cinematic like the ones of today.

I was fortunate enough to share a computer with my older brother. I’m pretty certain
my parents didn’t know what a computer was used for, but must have thought: “This
future-device will surely make my children Men... of... the... Future... future... future...
future...” (just pretend the word is echoing).

And to some degree, they were correct: if they hadn’t purchased my brother and
me a computer, who knows what I would be doing with my life right now? Certainly not
writing this book and helping you to program like a hero!

But having a giant paperweight made of jumbled electronics – back then we called
it an Apple IIe – wasn’t enough to entice me to use it all that much. After all, I also
happened to own a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) as well and it had an amazing
slew of games that I still – embarrassingly – play to this day.

What really got me into computers was this: I had a friend, Nicholas, who knew all
about programming computers. He showed me one day how to “hack” into the code
of a few of our favorite text-based games to give ourselves an advantage. It was akin to
creating your very own cheat code in a video game. In particular, we played a game called
Lemonade Stand, which was exactly the same as standing outside your house and selling
homemade Lemonade, only you never made real money and you didn’t get a sunburn.

In the game, you started out with a couple of dollars – barely enough to make any
real profit. However, once we looked at the code running the game, we figured out that
we could start out with however much money we wanted if we just changed a few words
around. Soon enough, I was the world’s first millionaire Lemonade Stand mogul.

I was hooked.

From there, it was not a far stretch to conceive that we could actually create our
own video games and that is exactly what we did. From complex role-playing games
(RPG) based off of our favorite comic books and Dungeons & Dragons to programs that
would ask our friends a series of questions and then make fun of them based off of their
answers – shenanigans!

While all of that seemed silly at the time, looking back on it I now know that it helped
set the foundation for my love of programming and, to a degree, writing (though I began
writing much earlier than that). Without that summer of programming fun, I would
never have had the wonderful experiences, friends, jobs, and writing opportunities that
have come my way ever since.

And, mostly, I would never have had the fun of programming either.
That is what I am hoping to pass on to you, dear reader: a lifetime love of
programming and opportunities all based off of one thing – the fun and joy of writing
computer programs and writing code.

Sure, programming applications can be a pain in the butt. You will find yourself
banging your head against a keyboard on many nights and yelling at the computer
screen for hours only to find that your program isn’t working because you forgot a
parenthesis () somewhere.

But – once you find that mistake that you or another programmer made – there isn’t
quite anything like that triumphant moment when you realize that you – YOU – are the
greatest coder of all time!

Programming Dos and Don’ts
==========================

When reading this book, you may find yourself feeling the urge to skip ahead a little or
might want to skip an exercise or two. As in all things in life, this piece of advice holds
true in learning to program as well: if you cheat, you are only cheating yourself.

To help keep you on the straight and narrow, here are some dos and don’ts for
reading this book and for learning how to program, in general:

Do read the book straight through. While you might be okay to skip a chapter or an
exercise here or there, keep in mind that this book is all about building a foundation
of not just coding language, but coding practices, theory, and an understanding of
programming principles that you can take with you that apply to other languages as well.

Don’t copy and paste code from this book or any other source (assuming you have a
digital copy). Instead, take the time to type in the code so that you can begin to get a feel
for writing code and, perhaps, commit some of the code to memory through repetition.

Do experiment with code. One of the best ways, I’ve found, to learn how to truly
code is to experiment. If you come across an example in the book, feel free to change the
parameters some and see what happens. The worst that can happen is that you can fail.
The best? That you learn something new!

Don’t be afraid to Google other tutorials and how-tos on Python. This book is
supposed to build a beginner’s foundation, but it does not teach you everything there is
to know – that’s what the sequel is for! If you do decide to look up comparative examples,
be certain to look at the date of the article and the version of Python. If the version does
not match the version we are using in this book (Python 3), odds are your code will not
work and you will find yourself very confused.

Do document your code. We have not covered this topic – yet – but for now, know
that documentation means to leave little comments in blocks, or sections, of your code
that lets you (or another coder in the future) know what you intended to do with a certain
section of code. While Python is a very readable language, the way every programmer
codes is different, and what might be apparent to you is not always apparent to others.
Also, if you have to review your own code at a later date, it will make it easier for you to
remember what, exactly, you were trying to do at 4 a.m. 10 years ago!

Do plan out your code. That is, write down how you want your overall program to
work and then break that down into little sections. Then, take those little sections and
map out what you need to code for each part. This way you will have a roadmap to follow
and won’t just be coding by the seat of your pants.

Finally, do test your code frequently and save your work often. When we
programmers are in the thick of things, we like to carry on, plugging away, for hours at a
time. However, if we don’t stop to test our code and save our files, we risk losing hours of
work and, worse, creating a program with problems that are difficult to trace.

c01 Introduction to Computer Programming and Python
---------------------------------------------------

Computer programming – commonly referred to as “coding” by the cool kids – is the
art of creating applications or software. These programs allow us to do everything from
solve simple math problems and watch our favorite YouTube videos (I can’t get enough
of skydiving bulldogs) to destroying hordes of rampant aliens in our favorite video games
and even launching a real-life spaceship into outer space.

I call computer programming an “art” because it is. Anytime you create something,
you are indulging in an art form. Sure, computer code, the words we type into a shell to
create our programs (more on this later!), may not be pretty to look at for the common
person on the street – your code will never see the inside of an art exhibit most likely –
but when a part of your program does what you created it to... there is almost nothing
more magical.

Well, maybe those skydiving bulldogs.

A computer program can come in many shapes and sizes. In addition to an
application that runs on your desktop system or a game that plays on your favorite video
game console, programs also take the form of mobile apps on a cell phone. You can even
find pieces of software that operate things like refrigerators, your mom’s minivan, and
even something as simple as a toaster oven.

And robots. Armies of robots.

But more on that later.

For now, know that a computer program is a set of code, created in a programming
language, that tells a device to carry out a set of instructions.

Programming Language Overview
-----------------------------

As mentioned, a computer program is written using a programming language. Just like
the real language you, I, and the rest of the world speak every day, computer languages
come in all shapes and sizes. While most of them make sense to the trained eye, a
newcomer to code would sound like a crazy person spouting gibberish if they tried to
use it in everyday conversation. That dialogue might look something like this:

Normal Person: Hello, how are you?
Programmer (You): Print I am fine! Input, how are you?

Fortunately for all involved, computers are fluent in programming languages
(thanks, in part, to our friend the compiler – but more on this later!) and can easily
understand the most complex of sentences you type in.

For the purpose of this book, we will stick to one of the most versatile, yet easy-to-
learn, languages, Python. While the name sounds frightening, keep in mind, it could
be worse: it could be called Cobra. In truth, the language was not named after a reptile
at all, but, instead, an old television comedy from Britain called Monty Python and the
Flying Circus.

Here’s your first assignment: Go ask your parents about that show. See you in a few
hours!

Oh, you are back. Great. Did what they said make any sense? Probably not. But that’s
okay; you don’t need to understand the complexities of British comedy to learn how to
program using this book. All you need is a desire to learn, a computer, and the pages in
front of you.

Python Overview
---------------

Python is what is known as a high-level, dynamic, interpreted, object-oriented
programming language. While all of that may sound a bit intimidating, never fear! By
the end of this book, you will be able to impress your friends with sentences much more
daunting than the one above! All that statement really means is that Python is not a
basic machine-level language, and as such, it needs an “interpreter” to “compile” it to
machine language so that the computer can understand what it is you are trying to tell it.

This interpreter takes your code and converts it – or compiles it – into a series of 1s
and 0s that a computer can plainly understand. All of that happens in the background, so
don’t worry if you do not quite understand it just yet.

Python is a relatively new programming language that was created in the late 1980s –
back when your dad had a big funny mustache and your mom listened to bands with
names like Wham! and Poison.

The man that created the language was a computer genius named Guido Van
Rossum, who was bestowed with the fancy, nonsensical title, Benevolent Dictator for
Life. Like technology, programming languages evolve as well, and Python is no different.
It has gone through several versions over the years and is currently known as Python 3.

How Does Python Differ from Other Programming Languages?
--------------------------------------------------------

Python differs from other programming languages in a number of different – yet
important – ways. For starters, Python is typically easier to learn and use than languages
in the same class, such as Java and C++. Programs created in Python also take less time
to create, as it requires less code (in general). This is due, in part, to Python’s data types –
a term we will cover in great detail in an upcoming chapter.

Python is also extremely versatile. While it may not be the primary choice, Python
can be used for applications in virtually every arena, including gaming, desktop software,
mobile apps, and even virtual reality. It is also a must for network programming and an
essential tool in a computer security toolbox.

The Benefits of Python
-----------------------

Python is currently the most-used programming language in the world today and is the
fastest growing as well. And with good reason. Below are just a few ways in which Python
can benefit a programmer:

• Increased productivity: By some reports, Python can increase a
programmer’s productivity – how much work they can accomplish
in a given time – by as much as ten times! It literally is faster than a
speeding bullet!

• Extensibility: One great advantage of Python is the fact that it has a
very extensive library of, well, libraries. A library is a set of existing
code you can add-in to your program. These libraries cover things
that are common features of a program and save you from having
to write the code over and over again yourself. For example, instead
of having to write a section of code to perform a complicated
mathematical equation, you can supply use a library and save
yourself a huge headache.

• Python is easy to read: One tough part of being a programmer is the
fact that, sometimes, your code does not work. When that happens,
you might find yourself re-reading your code – or worse, someone
else’s – to try and figure out why your program is not behaving as it
should. Fortunately, Python is easy to read and most of the language
makes sense at a glimpse. This makes finding issues a lot easier than
more complicated languages.

• Portability: Python runs on many platforms and systems, meaning
your programs can reach a wider audience.

• Internet of Things (IoT): The Internet of Things may sound like a
magical world full of digital beasts, and in some ways, it is. The IoT
consists of smart objects – light switches, doorknobs, toaster ovens,
appliances – that you find in your everyday home. These household
appliances are controllable by voice commands and mobile devices,
making them more interactive than their primitive predecessors.
I mean sure, your mom and dad yelled at the dishwasher all the
time – but did it ever listen? Now, thanks to the IoT and languages like
Python, it can! You still have to put your dishes inside of it, but still!

• Python frameworks: Frameworks are like skeletons for a program –
they allow you to quickly set up the basics for certain types of
applications without needing to code common elements that
usually exist in the type of software you are developing. This saves
programmers time and reduces the number of errors that can occur
when you have to manually code. Python is supported by a large
number of frameworks that can make launching a new program very
rapid indeed!


• Python is fun: Python is a fun language to learn; as stated, not only
is it easy to get started, but the Python community host many fun
events and challenges. For example, many people write their Python
code in poetry form and there are numerous Python “challenges”
released every year to help test a coder’s skills.

• Python is flexible: Because Python has so many uses and is used by
so many companies around the world, finding a job after learning
Python is easier than with other languages. In addition, if you do
not like a given field, you can always use your Python skills to try a
different path. For example, if you find that coding applications is
boring, you could switch to network administration or work at an IT
security firm.

And those are just a few of the benefits and advantages that Python offers.

Examples of Python in the Wild
-------------------------------

While it is impossible to say just how many companies around the world use Python,
there are a number of interesting businesses that rely on the language. Below is just a
smattering of them:

• Wayne Enterprises (Batman’s Alter Ego’s corporation): Well, we don’t
really know that, but wouldn’t that be cool!

• Google: The search engine giant and one day ruler of the galaxy,
Google, has been using Python since its inception, partially because
developers can build programs so quickly with it and also because
the code is easy to maintain.

• Facebook and Instagram: While Python is not the only language used
at these two social media platforms, it is one of their most important
ones. Facebook uses Python, in part, thanks to its extensive libraries.
Instagram, meanwhile, is a firm supporter of one of Python’s main
web frameworks – Django. We cover web frameworks in great detail
later in this book.

• Netflix: If you are a fan of streaming movies, then you are no stranger
to Netflix. The company uses Python primarily for its data-analysis
capabilities and for security purposes – among other areas.

• Video games: Battlefield 2 and Civilization 4 are just two video games
that both rely on Python. Interestingly enough, Civilization uses
Python for, among other things, its artificial intelligence (AI) scripts.

• Government agencies and institutions: Government agencies and
institutions including NASA, The National Weather Service, and the
CIA all use Python – though how it is used is Top Secret! Meet us in
the garage with a briefcase full of money and we’ll tell you all about it!

Your First Python Program
-------------------------

By now, you are probably wondering what Python code looks like. Well, fear not! I
am going to show you a sample snippet. Later, after we install Python and an IDLE
(integrated development environment) on your computer, you can try and execute – or
run – the code to see it in action. For now, though, I thought it would be a good idea to
just give you a taste before delving any further into the language.

Traditionally, when a programmer writes their first ever line of code, they create a
program called, “Hello, World,” as a metaphorical way to introduce themselves to the
world. However, as budding super heroes – or villains (no judgment here) – we need
something a little flashier.

Behold, your first Python program!

print("Look up in the sky! Is it a bird? Is it a plane?")
print("Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun")
print("No you dummy. That's just some guy flying around in his pajamas. Now
get back to work!")

If you were to run this code, the result would be:

Look up in the sky! Is it a bird? Is it a plane?
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun
No you dummy. That's some guy flying around in his pajamas. Now get back
to work!

Let’s examine the code a little more closely. The part that says print() is known
as a function, whose job it is to tell the computer to – in this case – print something to
the user’s screen. The text in between the opening and closing parentheses () is the
parameter that we are providing the function. The characters in between the quotation
marks “ ” are known as a string.

Don’t worry if this doesn’t make all the sense in the world just yet – we go over this
topic in great detail in the next chapter. For now, just know that this is what Python code
looks like. Odds are, you were able to tell exactly what this program would do before I
told you; that is just one of the things that make Python so great – its readability!

Installing Python
-----------------

In this section, we are going to learn how to install Python on the various operating
systems. An operating system is a piece of software that lets you interact with a computer.
You are probably familiar with the more popular ones, such as Microsoft Windows (if
you own a PC) and Mac OS X if you own an Apple computer. The version of Python you
install will vary depending upon which one of these your computer uses. In addition, we
will learn how to install Python on Linux and Ubuntu systems as well.

Installing Python on Windows
----------------------------

To begin, open up a web browser and navigate to the official Python website and its
download page: www.python.org/downloads/ (Figure 1-1).

The current version of Python is 3.6.5; by the time you read this book, it may be
higher than that. Whatever the case, click the “Download Python” button under the
Download the Latest Version for Windows header. Optionally, you could scroll down and
download previous versions (just make sure they are version 3.X or higher, as there are
incompatibility issues between versions 2.X and 3.X); however, for the purposes of this
book, it is always best to use version 3.6.5 or later.

An image will appear asking if you would like to save the file. Click “Save File”
(Figure 1-2) and save it to your Desktop or somewhere easily remembered.

The installer will launch and will ask you whether you wish to “Install Now” or
“Customize Installation.” For ease, we are going to allow the installer to “Install Now.”
Before you click that button, however, make sure that “Install launcher for all users”
and “Add Python 3.6 to PATH” are both checked. Then click the “Install Now” option
(Figure 1-4).

You may get a pop-up from Windows asking for permission to continue the
installation. If so, allow the program to continue. A new pop-up will appear, showing you
the Setup Progress (Figure 1-5):

Once Setup is complete, you will see a screen like the one below. Click the “Close”
button to complete installation (Figure 1-6).

You should now have Python installed on your computer. You can find it in your
“Start” menu, labeled Python 3.6 (or whichever version you installed).

When you launch Python, the first thing you see is the shell, which is a piece of the
development environment where you can write a line of code, test code, run code, and
create Python files. Figure 1-7 shows an example of how the Python Shell will appear
once launched.

At the top of this shell window, you can see the current version of Python and some
other information. You will also see three greater-than symbols or arrows (>>>). These
are known as the command prompt and it is here that you will type in your instructions
to Python.

Ready to dive in? Let’s type in some simple code and see what happens! Enter the
following into the prompt:

print("Look up in the sky! Is it a bird? Is it a plane?")

When you finish, press Enter and you should see a result that looks like the following
(Figure 1-8):

If not, re-check your code and make sure you spelled everything properly and
remembered to insert your parentheses () and quotation marks “ ”.

Since we are working directly in the shell, our code gets executed – or run – in real
time. In this instance, it ran a single line of code, which told the computer to print a line
of text to the screen.

In the real world, we want to create actual Python files so that we can save our
programs for later use and to help us save us from re-writing thousands of lines of code
each time we want to run our program.

Fortunately, Python IDLE – or development environment – lets us create Python
files, that is, files that end in the extension .py, quite easily. All you have to do is click File,
then New File (see Figures 1-9, 1-10, and 1-11).

A new window will pop up. This is where you can write your code and save it for later.
That being said, let’s enter in the example code we just used. Then click File, then Save.

Enter in the name of the file and click the Save button to finish creating the file. For
the purposes of this book, let’s keep things simple and name our file Example1.py.

There you have it – you created your very first real-world Python program. To run this
program, click Run and then choose Run Module. Your program will now execute in the
Python shell! (Figure 1-12).

Now, let’s wrap things up: remember the original first program we wrote at the
beginning of this chapter? Let’s enter that into our Example1.py file and click Save once
you are finished. Here is the code again:

print("Look up in the sky! Is it a bird? Is it a plane?")
print("Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun")
print("No you dummy. That's just some guy flying around in his pajamas. Now
get back to work!")

Once you have saved the file, click Run and choose Run Module to see the full code
in action! (Figure 1-13).

Installing Python on Other Operating Systems
--------------------------------------------

This book uses Python installed on a Windows-based computer; while the code inside
will work on any computer, the actual installation of Python will vary based off of your
operating system.

To install Python on Mac OS X, open a web browser and navigate to www.python.
org/downloads/mac-osx/. Choose the “Latest Python 3 Release” link and follow the
instructions and prompts to complete the Setup and Installation process.

To install Python on Unix/Linux systems, open a browser and go to www.python.
org/downloads/source. Click the link for the “Latest Python 3 Release” and follow the
instructions to complete the Setup and Installation process.

In This Episode!
----------------

We certainly covered a lot in this chapter, but it is nothing compared to what we will
unmask in the chapter to come! Here is a brief list – a summation if you will – of the
things we covered thus far (hey, we are programming heroes now, we have to speak the
lingo as well!)

• Python is a programming language that lets you program computers,
mobile devices, video games, artificial intelligence systems, the
Internet of Things (IoT) devices, web-based applications, and even
virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR).

• A program or application is a group of code that lets you give a
computer or device a set of instructions to carry out.

• Programmers that know Python can pursue careers in programming,
network administration, IT security, video game development,
mobile application creation, forensic computer science, and more.

• Python works across multiple platforms, including Windows PCs, Mac
computers, mobile devices, Unix/Linux-driven computers, and more.

• Python can be used to prevent hacking via a set of skills and modules
known as “ethical hacking” tools.

• IDLE stands for integrated development environment; it is where we
create our Python code and files.

• Files created by Python end in the file extension “.py”.

• The current – as of this writing – version of Python is 3.6.5. If you are
reading this book, be sure to use this version or later.

• The print() function lets you print text to a user’s screen. For
example, print("Hello Wall!") would print the text: Hello Wall! to
the computer screen.

• Many organizations and companies around the globe use Python,
including Facebook, Google, Snapchat, NASA, the CIA, and more!

• Python is the most-used – and fastest growing – computer
programming language in the world.
